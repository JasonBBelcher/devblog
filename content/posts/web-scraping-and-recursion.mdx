## Walk down the stairs with recursion.

I presented myself a challenge the other day. That challenge is to be able to scrape any webpage for the number of times a phrase
or word is used.

The DOM is a tree of nodes. We can traverse down it using recursion until we hit a node that returns null and then stop. That will be our base case.
The following example is a trivial example. It does however resemble one branch of the DOM tree we need to travel down in order to discover words and
phrases. Try it out and watch how each call to the recursive function adds to the execution stack. Then notice that after it reaches null (base case) it pops off
the stack until finally after the stack is empty it will return null and fire off the console.log that is embedded in the base case conditional.

### Simplified DOM Like Traversal Example

```javascript
// Simple recursion example that walks down a bunch of nested objects till it finds a null value.

const parentNode = {
  value: {
    node: {
      value: {
        node: {
          value: {
            node: {
              value: {
                node: {
                  value: {
                    node: {
                      value: {
                        node: {
                          value: {
                            node: {
                              value: null,
                            },
                          },
                        },
                      },
                    },
                  },
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

function walkitDown(node) {
  debugger
  let value = node.value
  if (value === null) {
    console.log("you found mr. null!")
    return null
  }
  if (typeof value === "object" && value !== null) {
    return walkitDown(value.node)
  }
}

walkitDown(parentNode)

// "You found mr. null!"
```

Try copy pasting this code into the console in your chrome browser. Watch what happens on each step. Other-wise you can watch this
helpful animated gif of the debugger.

<div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(62.50% + 44px)">
  <iframe
    src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/SparklingBaggyIguana"
    frameborder="0"
    scrolling="no"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>

### DOM traversal

We can traverse the DOM using the same technique from above but a little digging needs done first to find out what properties
to use. The DOM is a tree so there will be siblings and child nodes. Lets google that real
quick. I'm looking for any properties that eventually become null. We will check against null to short circuit the recursion.

[Node.firstChild](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/firstChild) & [Node.nextSibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nextSibling) look like just the ticket. Both have return null if they happen to be the last child of the parent. Check out
the links to see the full description of each property we will use. We will use [Node.nodeTypes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeType) to check if
the the current node is in fact actual text or just an element. If it's an element we want to ignore it.

```javascript
function search(wordToMatch) {
  debugger // drop this function in the chrome console and watch the debugger run.
  let walkedDOM = []
  const results = []
  function walk(node, callback) {
    callback(node)

    node = node.firstChild
    // base case
    while (node != null) {
      // if base case is not reached then we recurse
      walk(node, callback)

      node = node.nextSibling
    }
    return node
  }

  walk(document.body, node => {
    // set a break point here to see how it recurses and pay special attention to the call stack
    if (node.nodeType === 3) {
      walkedDOM.push(node.nodeValue)
    }
  })

  // RECURSION DONE
  const wordRegex = wordToMatch ? new RegExp(wordToMatch, "ig") : false
  /*
   we simply iterate over the array,
  lowercase each fragment, by this time
   all recursion is done do a simple regex
   match against it and if a fragment returns
   true we push to a results array
  */

  walkedDOM.forEach(textFragment => {
    textFragment = textFragment.toLowerCase()
    if (textFragment.match(wordRegex)) {
      results.push(wordRegex.exec(textFragment))
    }
  })

  /* return number of matches we got on the webpage.
  I'm using a computed key name based on
  the original word passed in at the beginning.
  */

  return { [wordToMatch]: results.length }
}
```

You can take this entire script and drop it into the console and test it on any webpage.
Try it on the front of a news site and type a phrase or word to see how many hits you get.
Run it through the debugger and step over each recursive call and watch as the call stack shrinks
and expands. If you would like to look at some simpler examples of recursion you can check out my
