title: Common App Challenge Pattern (Angular Version)
date: 2019-10-28
---

I've run into a common reoccuring pattern in fullstack and front end developer interviews lately. Most of them consist of a few simple requirements that test
your ability to do things like manipulate json data coming from an api or database and to build interactive and functional user interfaces.

The requirement goes something like this:

Build an app in framework X that will pull from some rest endpoint and populate a search-able list with a collapse-able detail view.
Do as much as you can in 30 minutes. It's harder than you might think with a panel of developers staring at you while you attempt to
calm your nerves enough to think critically inside a fog of panic.

How do you get better at this type of interview style? Only one way I know of. Build it over and over and do it in as many ways as you
possibly can and time it. The goal for things like this is not code that scales or has to stand any test of time. The goal is to show
that you have the baseline skill set to do the job in as little time as possible.

So what did I do? I obsessed on it and built the exact same application 3 times over in [Vanilla.js (MVC)](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vanilla-js-filter-search-demo), [React](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-filter-search-demo), and [Angular](https://codesandbox.io/s/angular-902cr?fontsize=14).

## Angular Filter Search Demo

The angular version consists of just a few pieces.

- service (ajax)
- component (code behind file)
- component (template)
- interface (contract)
- and some css styles

### api service

I started with the api service. I usually prefer to start with the data.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core"
import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http"
import { Observable } from "rxjs"

@Injectable()
export class ApiService {
  url: string

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {
    this.url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
  }

  getUsers(): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.get(this.url)
  }
}
```

---

A service in angular is a singleton class. All this means is that it gets instantiated once and only once. In practical terms I would use services when you
want to give access to data throughout the many components in your application from a single source. I think of a service as a place
to store the state of the application or to make ajax requests to an api.

All we are doing is declaring a url property of type
string and setting it up with an endpoint inside the constructor. There is only one service method needed. I've named it
getUsers. Notice that the return type is an observable and the method returns the result of getting the data from the url.

If you aren't used to using Observables it can take some getting used to. A simple description might be that an Observable
opens a stream of data when new values are available it publishes them to the observable stream and on the other end whatever is
listening can get the data. We won't get into it but you can then use Rxjs to manipulate and transform the data using rx operators.

In order to get the data out you can subscribe `this.api.getUsers().subscribe()` or load it into a variable of type observable
`this.users$ = this.api.getUsers();`

If you prefer to use promises you can convert it to a promise like so.

```typescript

 getUsers():Promise<any> {
     return this.http.get(this.url).toPromise();
   }

```

### Search List component

```typescript
// app component

@Component({
  selector: "my-app",
  templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"],
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  users$: Observable<IUser[]>

  constructor(private api: ApiService) {}
  ngOnInit() {
    this.users$ = this.api.getUsers()
  }
}
```

---

Using the ngOnInit lifecycle hook I load the `users$` variable with the result of calling the api service method
getUsers. Then from the template using the `*ngFor` directive I can loop over the observable stream of users.
Here is how you do that.

```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let user of users$ | async">
    <h2>{{ user.name }}</h2>

    <div>
      <p>{{ user.address.street }}</p>
      <p>{{ user.address.suite }}</p>
      <p>{{ user.address.city }}</p>
      <p>{{ user.address.zipcode }}</p>
      <p>{{ user.email }}</p>
      <p>{{ user.phone }}</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
```

---

Notice the use of the async pipe. If you load a template with an Observable stream you must use the async pipe or
nothing works. If we had subscribed to the service method like this `this.api.getUsers().subscribe(users => this.users = users)`
we would not need the async pipe.

So we have the data from the api and we have it displayed in the component. Next it would be nice to show or hide the details
of the user address for each user in the list.

```typescript

// component method

 showHide(user: IUser) {
    user.show = !user.show;
  }



```

---

Since in javascript you can dynamically create properties and the property initially created will be undefined
it will resolve to false. There is no need to set an initial value. Good old type coersion to the rescue. When the showHide()
method is triggered it will simply start flipping a boolean from there.

```html
<!-- component template -->
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let user of filteredUsers">
    <h1 (click)="showHide(user)">{{user.name}}</h1>

    <div *ngIf="user.show">
      <p>{{user.address.street}}</p>
      <p>{{user.address.suite}}</p>
      <p>{{user.address.city}}</p>
      <p>{{user.address.zipcode}}</p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
```

Using the `*ngIf` directive just check against the show property that will be created for each clicked item.

Now that show/hide functionality is done I'll move on to the hardest part of the challenge, that of filter searching
a list of users based on user input.

```typescript

// inside component

search(value:string) {
    if(value) {


      this.filteredUsers$ = this.users$
      .pipe(
        // the stream is of a single item that is of type array
        // map(user => user.name) would not work because it is not // a stream of items inside the array
        map((users: IUser[]) => {
          // inside the map we use the native Array.prototype.filter() method to filter down the results by name
          return users.filter((user: IUser) => user.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(value.toLowerCase()) > -1)
        })

      )
  } else {
    // reload the full data set
    this.filteredUsers$ = this.users$;
  }
}

```

To understand what is happening here you need to understand that with observable streams you will get a stream of the array
and not a stream of array values. If we had converted to promises this code above would be more like this.

```typescript

search(value:string) {
    if(value) {
    this.filteredUsers =  this.users.filter((user: IUser) => user.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(value.toLowerCase()) > -1);

    } else {
      // reload the full list
      this.filteredUsers = this.users;
    }
  }

```

In either case I'm using the Array.prototype.filter method to return a new array list of user objects consisting of the returned
indexOf any array objects with a property of name that match the search criteria coming from the input.

```html
<!-- component template -->
<div class="container">
  <header>
    <h1>Angular Filter Search Demo</h1>
  </header>
  <input
    class="search-box"
    placeholder="start typing to narrow search"
    (keyup)="search($event.target.value)"
    type="text"
  />
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let user of filteredUsers$ | async">
      <h2 class="user" (click)="showHide(user)">{{user.name}}</h2>

      <div class="collapse-able" *ngIf="user.show">
        <p>{{user.address.street}}</p>
        <p>{{user.address.suite}}</p>
        <p>{{user.address.city}}</p>
        <p>{{user.address.zipcode}}</p>
        <p>{{user.email}}</p>
        <p>{{user.phone}}</p>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

---

Inside the template trigger the class method with event syntax `(keyup)="search($event.target.value)"` passing in the event
object then accessing the inputs value.

That does it for the functionality requirements of this little demo application. Dress it up with a bit of css and away you go!
