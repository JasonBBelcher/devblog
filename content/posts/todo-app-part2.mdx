title: MEAN Stack Todo App Part 2
date: 2019-11-10

In part one an Angular front end todo application was built with a Mock service to handle all CRUD operations. Local Storage was
used to persist data between browser refreshes. The application was setup with a real back-end in mind to eventually take over the job.

This is why you saw the use of `Promise.resolve()`. When building a prototype it's good to think about how your data will be accessed
even before hooking it up. If I had returned just the data in a synchronous manner a lot of refactored component code would be needed
to put the pieces together. Instead I set it up to be able to easily switch out the mock service methods for the real thing.

Now on to the back end code!

## Node Express Backend

Below is a simple error handler to catch all errors properly. This will be registered as a global middleware that Express
will use to funnel all errors through.

```javascript
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  return res.status(err.status || 500).json({
    err: {
      message: err.message || "Something went wrong.",
    },
  })
}
```

## Initialize the Express Application

This part sets up common middleware needed in most Express apps. Cors is there to allow for access
from other domains and ports. Morgan is a simple logging middleware useful for debugging.

For this tutorial I decided to use
[mlab](https://docs.mlab.com/connecting/). It's an awesome way to get up and running
without having to install a local mongo database.

The database URI is usually pulled in using an environment variable.

A common tool for this is called
[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) Never check in database connections that contain passwords to
any public github or gitlab account. It's only done here for demonstration purposes.

The [monk db library](https://automattic.github.io/monk/) is loaded and the database url is registered
with it. After that a todos collection is created.

```javascript
// initializing the app
const express = require("express")
const app = express()

// logging middle ware
const morgan = require("morgan")
// cors allows you to hit the api endpoints from a different domain or port
const cors = require("cors")
// usually pulled from an environment variable using dotenv.
const dbUrl = `mongodb://<username>:<password>1@ds141248.mlab.com:41248/codesandbox`
// using monk a thin wrapper around mongodb
const db = require("monk")(dbUrl)
// initialize the collection
const todos = db.create("todos")

// register the logging middleware
app.use(morgan("dev"))

// register express to now parse json
app.use(express.json())
// register cors middleware so that the api
// can be used from a different domain and port
app.use(cors())
```

## Build the CRUD routes

### GET All Todos

When client code makes a request to the url resource `http://<base_url>/todos` with the GET verb
Express matches the route and fires off the handler defined in the route. The handler
in this case is an anonymous function. Inside the handler the database is asked for every
todo in the collection.

```javascript
// GET all todos
app.get("/todos", (req, res, next) => {
  todos
    // find with no args will pull the entire collection
    .find({})
    .then(docs => {
      return res.json(docs)
    })
    .catch(next)
})
```

---

### POST A New Todo

When client code makes a request to the url resource `http://<base_url>/todo` with the POST verb
Express matches the route and fires off the handler defined in the route. The body of the request
is checked for the required properties needed to create a todo and checked for the correct type.
If it passes the test the database `insert()` method is called and the properties on the body of
the request are passed in. If the test fails a custom error is returned to the client.

```javascript
// POST a todo
.post("/todo", (req, res, next) => {
  // destructure all properties off
  const { text, priority, completed, uid } = req.body
  // the req.body property
  // check for the existance of
  // text uid, priority, and completed properties
    (typeof text === "string" &&
  if (
      typeof uid === "number" &&
      typeof parseInt(priority, 10) === "number" &&
      typeof completed === "boolean") ||
    req.body.length === 4
  ) {
    todos // insert a new todo into the database
      .insert({
        uid,
        text,
        priority,
        completed,
      })
      .then(doc => {
        return res.json(doc) // return the newly created record to the
        //front end in json format for deserialization by client
      })
      .catch(next) // catch any errors and pass along to errorhandler
  } else {
    // if all required properties aren't found inside
    // the req.body then return a custom error
    next({
      status: 400,
      message:
        "please provide uid, text, priority, and completed properties only.",
    })
  }
})
```

### UPDATE (PUT) A New Todo

When client code makes a request to the url resource `http://<base_url>/todo/:uid` with the PUT verb
Express matches the route and fires off the handler defined in the route. The body of the request
is checked for the required properties needed to create a todo and checked for the correct type.
If the test fails a custom error is returned to the client. If it passes the test the database
`findOneAndUpdate()` method is called and the properties on the body of the request are passed
into a [`$set` mongo operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/set/).

```javascript
// UPDATE a todo by uid
app.put("/todo/:uid", (req, res, next) => {
  const { uid } = req.params // destructure from params object
  // destructure required todo properties
  const { text, completed, priority } = req.body
  // check that these properties exist.  If not then
  //  do not update and throw error
  if (text && typeof completed === "boolean" && priority) {
    todos
      .findOneAndUpdate(
        {
          uid: parseFloat(uid),
        },
        {
          // $set is not specific to monk.
          // This is a native mongo driver operator
          // this allows us to update properties for
          // the record found by findOneAndUpdate
          $set: {
            text,
            completed,
            priority,
          },
        }
      )
      .then(updatedDoc => {
        // return a json response of the
        // updated document for deserialization by the client
        return res.json(updatedDoc)
      })
      .catch(next)
  } else {
    next({
      status: 400,
      message: "please provide text, priority, and completed properties.",
    })
  }
})
```

# DELETE One Todo by UID

When client code makes a request to the url resource `http://<base_url>/todo/:uid` with the DELETE verb
Express matches the route and fires off the handler defined in the route. The handler
in this case is an anonymous function. Inside the handler the `findOneAndDelete()` method is called and the
uid is passed in. The uid is created if you remember from the Entity class every time a new todo is created.
It's not a real uid but a simple random number of type float and is not guaranteed to be unique for large data sets.

In a real application situation I've seen this used [uuid generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid). Of course
the other option is to use \_id field generated by mongo on every created document. This is usually the preferred method.
I went with the genId method to show how to build the todo app purely in javascript first.
Regardless, the end result is the same for the job at hand.

```javascript
// DELETE a todo by uid
app.delete("/todo/:uid", (req, res, next) => {
  const { uid } = req.params

  todos
    .findOneAndDelete({
      uid: parseFloat(uid),
    })
    .then(doc => {
      return res.json(doc)
    })
    .catch(next)
})
```

### DELETE All Todos

```javascript
// DELETE all todos

app.delete("/todos", (req, res, next) => {
  todos.remove({}).then(() => {
    res.json([])
  })
})
```

---

#### Global Error Handling

This catches all errors other than the ones caught in the routes above.  
For any route that doesn't exist the error not found will be passed to the
`errorHandler` right before the `app.listen(8080)` statement.

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  let err = new Error("Not Found")
  err.status = 404
  next(err)
})

// register error handler to be used
// globally for all errors produced by express

app.use(errorHandler)

// this could come from an env var as well.
app.listen(8080)
```
